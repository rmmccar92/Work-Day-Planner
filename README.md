Work Day Planner 

For this assignment we were asked to alter some previously written code to work as intended. The application was a day schedule that allowed users to enter in events for the workday in order to keep track of things that needed to be done. Additionally the application was to change color based on the time of of day. Each hour was to indicate whether it was past present or future and display the appropriate color assigned to that value. 

The purpose of this assignment was to allow us to practice working with 3rd party APIs. Specifically we worked with Jquery UI, Moment, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and Google Fonts. While some of these elements were more complicated than others each had a role to play in the creation and function of the web application. Below you can see an image of the working application.
